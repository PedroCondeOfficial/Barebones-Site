		<h2>About &nbsp  Me</h2> 		
		<p> I'm Pedro Conde, a senior attending the University of South Florida. I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Health Science with concentrations in biological health
		science and health information technology. I'm currently in pursuit of a PhD in robotics, as my biology background led me to work in a computational biology lab in which I absolutely fell in love with
		computer science. Ever since then, I've been coding various things, many of which can be found in my "Projects" section and my GitHub. Aside from computers and technology, my passions include
		music production, language learning, and traveling. If you have any questions about my background, feel free to contact me! </p>

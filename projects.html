		<h2>Projects</h2> 
		
		<p class="projectsp"><strong>Current:</strong>I am currently working on making a webpage dedicated to my music, as well upgrading this one. I am also
			working on a solo game development project using Unreal Engine dubbed "One More Minute". "One More Minute"
			is a survival-horror game in which the player must keep their weapon, hunger, and thirst under control to survive
			against hordes of demons. On the side, I'm working on an application called "CytoTutor", an app dedicated to making
			biology fun to learn for younger students.<br/>
		<strong>Upcoming: </strong> My main future project is a an action-adventure game called Zodiac. In the game, the player assumes the role
			of a Roman god and must venture off in an attempt to purify the constellations. I will be working 
			in collaboration with a group of artists and programmers to produce this title, and possibly feature it on Steam.<br/>
		<strong>Past:</strong>Having volunteered in a computational biology lab, I got a lot of hands-on work. I mainly worked on a project
			dedicated to finding the effects of water on protein folding in conjuction with the University of Luxembourg. 
			Most of the work can be found on my GitHub. I also developed a DNA transcription/translation program for students
			struggling with the concept in genetics courses.<br/>

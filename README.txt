This is a basic site I made a while ago using just simple HTML and CSS. I have more sites posted using Bootstrap,
and with more interactivity, such as implementing Node.JS and AngularJS. 

To view the site as an actual webpage, go to https://rawgit.com/PedroCondeOfficial/Barebones-Site/master/index.html
